# Description

Ghana's popular Trotro system is prominent mode of transport in the country. But often it is not structured as it can get very random and difficult to navigate.
In this project, I attempt to structure the trotro system in a way way people can know how stations are linked, people who manage the stations, buses that drive to and from the stations etc.
